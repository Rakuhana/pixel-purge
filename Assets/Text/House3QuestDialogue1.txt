Ah! Hello. 
Oh you want to know about the Wizard?
You don't look quite tough enough to fight the Wizard, I'd rather not send such a young kid to his death...
However, if you could prove your strength, then maybe I could tell you a thing or two.
There is a well that has an old dungeon beneath it, it contains an heirloom of power that will help us resist the Wizards Magic.
If you get that for us, I will tell you all about the Wizard, and where he went, as well as protect you from his Magic.
Run along now, I'm busy!
